In this project I worked with some features of Angular like:

- Communication between components.
- Using Bootstrap.
- CSS and SCSS structure.
- Using the @input decorator I can modify the button properties from the buttons-container component and thus control the state of the button.
- Using the 'ngClass' directive to dynamically apply classes to the button component.
- Using the properties of the button component I apply different states as the case may be
